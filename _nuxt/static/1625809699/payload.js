It is therefore crucial to understand its impact on a societal and public policy level. Scenarios in problem areas: privacy, explainability, reliability and risks of complex systems, responsibility of professionals for applications and consequences of their work.\n\nCharlotte and Vanessa believe that data science and machine learning can help us design intelligent products, services, and systems that improve people’s everyday lives. But in order to have a truly positive impact, AI-powered technologies must be grounded in human rights and work to extend and enhance our capabilities, not replace them.\n",showResources:a,meetings:[{title:"Meet: Lightning Talk #2",description:g,type:e,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fus02web.zoom.us\u002Fj\u002F82570114983?pwd=TG5RVnQzQSsrSEozRmR1R2ZsQUc1dz09"}],forms:[{title:"Feedback: Lightning Talk #2",type:j,description:z,url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftechlabsorg.typeform.com\u002Fto\u002FU67ml5lG"}],resources:[{title:l,description:m,type:n,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.google.com\u002Fpresentation\u002Fd\u002F1wWsKf-5HX-fzCcV4UKMAf2v1mGYxSYRIpB7YAci30j0\u002Fedit?usp=sharing"},{title:o,description:p,type:q,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fdrive.google.com\u002Ffile\u002Fd\u002F1_svneBU5TeltdQ2CtPVBqQLGdxvVbHf9\u002Fview?usp=sharing"}],dir:h,path:"\u002Fevents\u002Flt-02-human-rights",extension:c,createdAt:b,updatedAt:b},{slug:"lightning-talk-3",title:"Lightning Talk #3: Doing what you can't",date:"2021-05-25T19:30:00+02:00",is_public:a,description:"[Vitor Alencar](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.instagram.com\u002Fvitormalencar\u002F) is a senior software engineer who loves to share knowledge, give talks and help other developers.
